# RedisDemo
Spring Redis is introduced with many features: is an open-source in-memory data source which can function as a message-broker, database, and a cache.
Supporting various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.

 - One thing to notice is we need Redis server running in you local to run this demo. I use docker to run a container
 an map port 6379 of Redis to a local port
