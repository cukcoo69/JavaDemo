# RedisDemo
Spring Redis is introduced with many features: NoSQL data, Sub, Pub, Stream... and lots of things I dont know.
This demo is only abt CRUD with Redis.

 - One thing to notice is we need Redis server running in you local to run this demo. I use docker to run a container
 an map port 6379 of Redis to a local port
